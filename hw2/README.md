# Implementation of IBM Model 1 and 2 using different initializations

To run the code for IBM model 1 write the following commands in the terminal

python IBM_Model_1 > alignment

python score-alignments < alignment

To run the code for IBM model 2 write the following commands in the terminal

python align > alignment 

python score-alignments < alignment

To specify different initializations conditions look at the comments in the end of the code, see line 190 for IBM model 2.
